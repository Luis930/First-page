          <p class="miggy">Jos√© Miguel Cabrera Torres (born April 18, 1983), nicknamed "Miggy", is a Venezuelan professional baseball first baseman and designated hitter for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). Since his debut in 2003 he has been a two-time American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winner, a four-time AL batting champion, and a 12-time MLB All-Star. He has played at first and third base for most of his major league career, but primarily played left and right field before 2006. He claimed the 17th MLB Triple Crown in 2012, the first to do so in 45 seasons. In 2022, Cabrera became the third player in history with a career batting average above .300, 500 home runs, and 3,000 hits, joining Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.

In the Venezuelan Winter League, Cabrera was signed by Tigres de Aragua at 16 years old. In this league, he recorded his first hit as a professional in December 1999, at age 16 years 8 months. Cabrera was signed in 1999 as an amateur free agent by the Florida Marlins, and progressed through their minor league system. He made his MLB debut in mid-2003 at the age of 20, and contributed to the Marlins' World Series success later that year.</p>
